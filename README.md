# Wikisource to LaTeX

Wikisource to LaTex is a Python program that I wrote to compile the _[Pentagon Papers](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_%E2%80%93_Vietnam_Relations,_1945%E2%80%931967:_A_Study_Prepared_by_the_Department_of_Defense)_ into a nicely-formatted LaTeX document.

Although you should feel free to reuse it as you like, this code will be pretty specific to the way the _Pentagon Papers_ document is being formatted on Wikisource.
